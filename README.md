# DNA and Protein Classification Baseline Models
Some DNA and protein sequence classifiers implemented with PyTorch. 
Models are various RNN models: vanilla RNN, GRU, and LSTM, which can each be bidirectional and include an embedding layer.
Custom dataset class to store, prepare, and batch sequence datasets in FASTA format.

Code was originally created for comparison with [iGakco-SVM](https://github.com/QData/iGakco-SVM), a new gapped k-mer support vector machine classifier for sequence annotation tasks.
